 
      Auto  Plant  Watering  with  Arduino  and  Java  -  Main  Project   Ben  Petlach  220938080  March  28,  2024  EECS  1021  -  Z                  Introduction  
The  Automated  Plant  Watering  System  is  designed  to  maintain  optimal  soil  moisture  levels  
by
 
integrating
 
an
 
Arduino-compatible
 
microcontroller
 
with
 
Java-based
 
control
 
software.
 
The
 
system
 
continuously
 
monitors
 
soil
 
moisture
 
and
 
activates
 
a
 
water
 
pump
 
when
 
necessary.
 
This
 
project
 
provides
 
an
 
excellent
 
example
 
of
 
an
 
embedded
 
system
 
that
 
utilizes
 
sensors,
 
actuators,
 
and
 
software
 
to
 
achieve
 
automation
 
in
 
plant
 
care.
  Context  
With  increasing  urbanization,  indoor  gardening  and  plant  maintenance  have  become  more  
popular.
 
However,
 
maintaining
 
a
 
consistent
 
watering
 
schedule
 
can
 
be
 
challenging.
 
This
 
project
 
automates
 
the
 
process,
 
ensuring
 
that
 
plants
 
receive
 
adequate
 
hydration
 
without
 
human
 
intervention.
 
Automated
 
watering
 
systems
 
are
 
crucial
 
for
 
efficient
 
agriculture,
 
smart
 
gardening,
 
and
 
even
 
space
 
exploration,
 
where
 
environmental
 
conditions
 
must
 
be
 
carefully
 
managed.
 

 
Technical  Requirements  -  Continuously  monitor  soil  moisture  using  a  sensor.  -  Trigger  a  water  pump  for  varying  durations  when  the  soil  moisture  falls  between  
certain
 
levels.
 -  Display  real-time  moisture  levels  and  system  status  on  an  OLED  screen.  -  Log  moisture  readings  using  a  Java  ArrayList  for  later  analysis.  -  Operate  autonomously,  checking  moisture  levels  at  regular  intervals  using  TimerTask.   Event  handling  is  achieved  using  a  TimerTask  in  Java,  which  periodically  reads  sensor  data  
and
 
controls
 
the
 
pump
 
accordingly.
 
The
 
OLED
 
display
 
provides
 
real-time
 
feedback
 
on
 
the
 
plant’s
 
condition.
  
 


 
Components  List  
-  Arduino  Grove  board  -  Soil  moisture  sensor  -  9V  battery  -  MOSFET  -  Water  pump  -  Water  tubing  and  reservoir   
  Procedures  
1.  Developed  and  planned  control  flow  of  the  project.  2.  Initialized  the  Grove  board  with  Firmata.  3.  Developed  Java  classes  for  sensor  readings,  pump  controls,  and  display  integration.  4.  Implemented  event-driven  programming  using  TimerTask  for  periodic  monitoring.  5.  Added  OLED  support  to  display  soil  moisture  data  and  system  status.  6.  Tested  the  system  by  allowing  the  soil  to  dry  and  observing  automatic  watering.  7.  Refined  the  logic  to  ensure  more  accurate  soil-watering  parameters.   Testing  
Unit  testing  involved  verifying:  -  Correct  soil  moisture  readings  under  dry  and  wet  conditions.  -  Proper  activation  and  deactivation  of  the  water  pump.  -  Accurate  logging  of  data.  


 
  Learning  Outcomes  
-  CLO  1 :  Debugging  Java-Firmata  integration  to  ensure  correct  hardware  
communication.
 -  CLO  2 :  Developed  an  event-driven  application  with  an  intuitive  API  for  controlling  
the
 
system.
 -  CLO  3 :  Used  Java  ArrayLists  to  store  and  analyze  moisture  readings  over  time.  -  CLO  4 :  Integrated  sensors  and  actuators  to  respond  dynamically  to  environmental  
changes.
 -  CLO  5 :  Created  a  practical,  object-oriented  Java  application  with  real-world  
engineering
 
applications.
  Conclusion  
This  project  successfully  automated  the  watering  process,  demonstrating  the  effectiveness  of  
integrating
 
hardware
 
with
 
software.
 
Future
 
enhancements
 
could
 
include
 
remote
 
monitoring
 
via
 
a
 
web
 
interface
 
or
 
integrating
 
additional
 
sensors
 
for
 
more
 
precise
 
environmental
 
control.
 
This
 
project
 
has
 
provided
 
hands-on
 
experience
 
in
 
embedded
 
systems,
 
sensor
 
integration,
 
and
 
Java
 
programming.
